NAME
    all::your::base::are::belong::to - perform multiple inheritance in Perl!

SYNOPSIS
     package My::Cat;
     use all::your::base::are::belong::to 'My::Mammal', 'My::WhiskeredThing';

DESCRIPTION
    OK, that abstract ("perform multiple inheritance in Perl!") makes this
    module sound really clever, but Perl supports multiple inheritance out
    of the box. So really this is just some silly syntactic sugar for
    setting up a module's inheritance chain. The example in the SYNOPSIS
    section is exactly equivalent to:

     package My::Cat;
     use parent 'My::Mammal', 'My::WhiskeredThing';

    which is roughly equivalent to:

     package My::Cat;
     BEGIN {
       require My::Mammal;
            require My::WhiskeredThing;
            push @My::Cat::ISA, 'My::Mammal', 'My::WhiskeredThing';
     }
